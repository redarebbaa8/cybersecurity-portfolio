# SOC 2 Control Matrix & Readiness Checklist  

This folder contains a **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (TSC) control matrix** designed to track implementation status, ownership, and evidence of controls for SOC 2 readiness.  

It includes two formats:  
- [SOC2_Risk_Register.xlsx](./SOC2_Risk_Register.xlsx) – Editable Excel version with filters, drop-downs, and color coding for tracking 
- **README.md** – Quick reference and overview  

---

## How to Use  
1. Update the **Implementation Status** field regularly (Implemented, Partial, In Progress, Not Implemented).  
2. Attach or link to **Evidence** (policies, screenshots, logs).  
3. Assign an **Owner** for accountability.  
4. Use the **Notes** column for observations, improvements, or audit findings.

## Next Steps  

This control matrix can be expanded by:  
- Adding **all Trust Services Criteria (TSC)** for Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy.  
- Linking to actual **policy documents** (e.g., Access Control Policy, Incident Response Policy).  
- Including a **Risk Register** to connect risks to SOC 2 controls.  
- Attaching **sample evidence packs** (redacted screenshots, log exports, training records).
