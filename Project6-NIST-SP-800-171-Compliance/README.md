# Project 6: NIST SP 800-171 Compliance

This project provides a **NIST SP 800-171 compliance** focused on key security controls, mapped with implementation examples, evidence, owners, and remediation timelines.  
It is designed in a **POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)** style, making it audit-ready for **DFARS, CMMC, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 alignment**.

---

## Objective
- Track and assess compliance with **NIST SP 800-171** requirements.  
- Provide a structured **control matrix** with status, owners, and evidence.  
- Highlight gaps and planned remediation with completion timelines.  
- Generate deliverables suitable for **client packs, readiness assessments, and interviews**.  

---

## Deliverables
- **Control Matrix (Excel)** â€“ [NIST_Control_Matrix.xlsx](./NIST_Control_Matrix.xlsx)  
  Includes 10 sample NIST controls with requirements, implementation, evidence, owners, status, and target dates.    

---

## How to Use
1. Open the **Excel Control Matrix** and review each control (mapped by ID and family).  
2. Update the **Status** field (Implemented, In Progress, Planned).  
3. Attach or link **Evidence** (configs, screenshots, logs, reports).  
4. Track **Planned Completion Dates** to maintain compliance visibility.

## Example Controls

| Control ID | Family                | Requirement                                | Status       | Owner       |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 3.1.1      | Access Control         | Limit system access to authorized users    | Implemented  | IT Security |
| 3.1.3      | Access Control         | Review & limit access rights periodically  | In Progress  | Compliance  |
| 3.6.1      | Incident Response      | Establish an IR capability                  | Implemented  | DPO         |
| 3.12.1     | Security Assessment    | Periodic security control assessments       | Planned      | Compliance  |
| 3.11.2     | Risk Assessment        | Conduct risk assessments annually           | In Progress  | Risk Manager|

## Next Steps
- Expand coverage to **all 110 NIST SP 800-171 controls**.  
- Develop **evidence packs** (configs, logs, screenshots, policies).  
- Automate compliance monitoring (Azure Policy, Sentinel).  
- Map controls to **DFARS, CMMC, ISO 27001, SOC 2** for unified compliance.

## Notes
- This project aligns with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and supports compliance readiness for **DoD contractors** under DFARS/CMMC.
